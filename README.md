Hello!

Welcome to my first project from General Assembly.

Ready, Fire, Aim

On day 1 of class they mentioned TicTacToe was the first project, but we wouldn't get the assignment for a few more weeks. I started on it anyway, knowing just enough javascript from our pre-work assignments to build the board and game logic.

The actual project entailed more than just a working game of TicTacToe: We needed users to create accounts, log in, log out, etc.; we needed jQuery; we needed to make calls to an API to store game data for each user; we needed to deploy our game through GitHub pages; we needed a detailed history of our progress through frequent commits.

I knew none of this on day 1 - I just wanted to make the game.

To start, I repurposed the HTML from a memory game we did in pre-work (click a card, flip it over, find its mate, etc.) I replaced the cards with divs, tooled around with css, until I had a game board; fixed-size, off-center, too many borders, but functional (yes!!).

Now it was time to make X's. Click events were left over from the memory game, so I just had to change the function and voil√†! X's! Sure, they were tiny and in the upper-left corner of the square but I had other things to worry about. Like how it was O's turn now.

I made a "turnsTaken" variable - "X" goes on odd turn numbers, "O" goes on even turns. Wait, X can replace O with a simple click? That's not good. How do I check for a winner? I LOVE these challenges.

Okay, X can't replace O if the div has something in it - a simple conditional statement. Check for winner? Well, there are 8 winning patterns on TicTacToe so I don't need a smart grid system or anything to check in all directions from each new move. Can I store data in the div attributes? (Turns out I can!) Because that would help me decide if the winner was X or O.

I copied the board data to an array, iterated through those 8 possible win states, created a game over message, and the game worked!

To reset the board, I just cleared the divs, their attribute data, set turnsTaken back to 0 and the game was back on. After tooling around with CSS, I even had a decent looking game board with full size X's and O's.

None of this is in the commit history, but that's what happens when you start the project before...

Proper Project Time

When we finally received the TicTacToe project I created a proper git repo and GitHub page.

I had to refactor a number of things. I replaced javascript commands with jQuery (so no more "document.getElementById" or the like). I built a new page-source from scratch instead of using the memory game framework. I remade the board with Bootstrap so it would scale in mobile. I translated my board array for API calls since I used a different format than it did. I created a sign-in process using a framework we learned in class.

Stretch Goals

Playing from multiple browsers. I also added some troll responses if a player continues to click a square that's already occupied.
